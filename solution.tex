There are numerous reasons why CSMA/E2CA is more useful when modeled as fully decentralized protocol. One being the removal of the Access Point (AP) as a single point of failure. Also, AP Beacons are no longer used as a control measure to estimate the number of contenders in the network, which in turn reduces the overall convergence time.

In order to model the protocol, it is treated a Decentralized Constraint Satisfaction (DCS) problem~\cite{DCSP, DCSP-E2CA} using the ACK as the only feedback information that identifies a successful transmission.
