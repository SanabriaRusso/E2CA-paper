Our future work will be focused on implementing CSMA/ECA in cheap commodity hardware. Doing so will open the door for evaluation under more realistic scenarios as well as provide insight on different communication aspects, for example those regarding channel errors, delay, synchronization and coexistence with other access protocols. Nevertheless, this is not a trivial task given that in requires flexible network interface hardware which is not commonly provided by manufacturers.
