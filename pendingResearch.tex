To produce a throughout analysis of CSMA/ECA, more evaluations need to be carried out under non-saturated conditions. Further enhancements include the reset of the backoff stage when the transmission queue is empty and to determine what is its impact on the overall performance of the protocol.

%Further enhancements to CSMA/ECA include the reset of the backoff stage when the transmission queue is empty as well as performance tests in non-saturated conditions. This introduces new challenges related to convergence time and delay which need to be leveraged.

Also, future development will be focused on implementing CSMA/ECA in cheap commodity hardware~\cite{WMP}. Doing so will open the door for evaluation under more realistic scenarios as well as provide insight on different communication aspects, for example those regarding channel errors, delay, synchronization, coexistence with other access protocols and real network traffic. 

%Nevertheless, this is not a trivial task given that in requires flexible network interface hardware which is not commonly provided by manufacturers.
